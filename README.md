## Overview

This project is a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) User Interface (UI) designed to manage users, roles, and permissions in a secure and efficient manner. It offers an intuitive interface for both admins and users, providing role-specific functionalities and enhancing the overall user experience.

The UI is responsive and adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, from desktop to mobile devices. It includes an admin dashboard for user and role management, as well as a simplified user dashboard for profile management and password management.

## Visual & Interactive Elements

### 1. **Form Validation**

### 2. **Notifications**
   - Real-time notifications for success or failure of user actions like role updates and password changes.

### 3. **Email Alerts**
